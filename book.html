    <p><h3>Synopsis
  	  <img border=2 src="Book_Cover.jpg" alt="Book_Cover" width=150 height=231 style="float: right;"><hr></h3>
  	  In a small village called Garhwal, there lived a little girl, Binya. In the village, the shopkeeper, Ram Bharosa keeps an old useless shop and sells warm Coca-Cola bottles and sweets to the school going kids. A beautiful blue umbrella has been given to Binya by some foreigners on a picnic in the hills in exchange for her leopard claw pendant. The people in her village have become very fond of her umbrella. Soon the shopkeeper becomes jealous and tries to buy it from Binya. As time passes , Ram Bharosa's feeling to get the umbrella turns in to an obsession. The school had been closed due to the arrival of the monsoon and Ram Bharosa employs a boy named Rajaram from the next village to work at the shop. When he comes to know about his master's desire to own the umbrella he makes an attempt to steal the umbrella, but Rajaram fails and gets caught, he then gives Ram Bharosa's name. Now everyone stopped coming to Ram Bharosa's shop. Ram Bharosa had got a bear necklace and he coated it with silver. However, Binya realizes her mistake that she shouldn't have shown off her umbrella as it was the cause for Ram Bharosa's suffering. Finally, at the end, Binya gives the umbrella to Ram Bharosa, who gifts her a necklace with a bear's claw. Since then, Ram Bharosa started keeping the umbrella for anyone to borrow and people again began to visit his shop.

    <!--Personal Opinion-->
  	<p><h3>What I learnt from the book<hr></h3>
  	I feel the main theme of the story is to keep others happy by giving out things you love the most. It is tough to renounce the things we love. The book is written in a simple and lucid manner. The author's approach was way more prominent to make such ordinary characters into heroic and others found opportunities to redeem themselves as well.</p><br>
