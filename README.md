# First-HTML-Project
Hi, this is my first HTML + CSS project. I have created a simple page which redirects you to either of the other two pages. The page lets you read about my favourite book or story depending on the selection made.

## homepage.html
This is the opening page. It contains a form which further has a dropbox menu to choose book or story.

## book.html
This contains a post on my favourite book. You are redirected to this page from the homepage based on the dropbox selection.

## story.html
This contains a post on my favourite story. Similar to book.html, you are redirected to this page from the homepage based on the dropbox selection.
