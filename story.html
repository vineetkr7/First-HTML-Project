    <p><h3>Synopsis
  	  <img border=2 src="Story_Cover.jpg" alt="Story_Cover" width=298 height=192 style="float: right;"><hr></h3>
  	  The narration of this story is by a French boy, Franz. He narrates events about the year 1870 when France was captured by Bismarck led Prussian forces. Furthermore, the Lorraine and Alsace districts went under Prussian rule. There was an order for the discontinuation of teaching French in these two districts. The French teachers were asked to leave. Consequently, the school French teacher M. Hamel was not able to stay in his old school. In spite of this, the last lesson from him was full of devotion and sincerity. Franz was afraid of M. Hamel. There was an anticipation of punishment when he came late to school that day. However, he learnt that this would be his last lesson. Soon, he realized the importance of this subject and how he would never be able to learn his mother tongue.

  	<p><h3>What I learnt from the story<hr></h3>
  	The moral is that one should not waste one's precious time just by living in the impression that there is plenty of time and postponing the important things for next day.</p><br>
